You can use the map by pasing query parameters in the url, exampel of request can be: 
http://127.0.0.1:5500/GoogleMaps.html?origin=fjerdingen&destination=vulkan&transporttype=TRANSIT

origin=fjerdingen -> this means that the startpoint is fjerdingen
destination=vulkan -> this means that the endpoint is vulkan
transporttype=TRANSIT -> this means that the transport type is transit and that means bus, tram etc..
